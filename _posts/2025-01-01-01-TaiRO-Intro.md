# 1: Introduction

## Introduction to Radiation Oncology

Radiation oncology is an important component of cancer treatment, with more than half of all cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy during the course of their illness [(Belanger et al., 2019)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6560/ab1817)[(Delaney et al., 2005)](https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cncr.21324). Among medical specialties, it is uniquely technology-intensive and computer-dependent, making it particularly well-suited for computational approaches and data science methods [(Vogelius et al., 2020)](https://febs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1878-0261.12685).

Radiotherapy (RT) employs high-energy radiation, such as photons, electrons, or protons, to target and destroy cancer cells by damaging their DNA, thus preventing them from growing and dividing [(Gao et al., 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01853). While the fundamental goal of radiation therapy can be stated simply as "irradiating the tumor while minimizing dose to healthy tissue," achieving this goal requires numerous complex calculations and computational methods [(Barragan-Montero et al., 2022)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6560/ac678a/pdf).

Radiation therapy can be delivered through different modalities, with External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT) and internal radiation therapy (brachytherapy) being the primary approaches [(Belanger et al., 2019)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6560/ab1817). Within external beam treatments, sophisticated delivery techniques such as Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) and Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) allow for precise dose delivery through optimized beam angles and intensities [(Gao et al., 2024).](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01853)

The radiotherapy planning process involves defining treatment targets like the Planning Target Volume (PTV), which encompasses the tumor and surrounding margins to account for positioning uncertainties [(Gao et al., 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01853). This planning process represents a mathematical optimization problem that must balance the conflicting objectives of delivering high doses to tumors while minimizing exposure to healthy organs [(Belanger et al., 2019)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6560/ab1817).

While significant advances have been made in the physical aspects of treatment planning, such as improved dosimetry and dose distribution, further improvements in radiotherapy outcomes to enable more personalized treatment approaches will require deeper understanding of fundamental radiobiological mechanisms through computational modeling [(Dionysiou et al., 2008)](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Critical-Parameters-Determining-Standard-Treatment-Dionysiou-Stamatakos/cb2fe240fc974d38e17c411b219004a331f65c6b). 

A [glossary](../_pages/glossary.md) of terms has been compiled to help demystify the acronyms and keywords in this field.

## AI In radiation oncology

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have emerged as transformative technologies in radiation oncology, offering solutions to many of the field's computational challenges and clinical workflows. At its foundation, AI encompasses computer systems capable of performing tasks at a level comparable to human intelligence, with applications ranging from image analysis to treatment optimization [(Thomas et al., 2020)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32305726/). Radiation oncology has historically been at the forefront of adopting therapeutic technologies, positioning the field to be revolutionized by advances in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning and deep learning [(Kiser et al., 2019)](https://jmai.amegroups.org/article/view/4996/html). The radiotherapy workflow is inherently dependent on information technologies and computational methods, making it a natural domain for AI integration. From image reconstruction and analysis to locate tumors and organs, to plan optimization for determining machine parameters that deliver the desired dose, computational algorithms form the backbone of modern radiotherapy treatments [(Barragan-Montero et al., 2022)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6560/ac678a/pdf). As AI continues to evolve, its applications in radiation oncology will expand, offering radiation oncologists and medical physicists powerful tools to enhance patient care. Understanding the intersection of AI with radiation therapy positions practitioners to better harness these technologies for improved outcomes [(Huang et al., 2024)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39105746/).

The clinical workflow of radiation therapy encompasses several steps: consultation, imaging simulation, contouring, treatment planning, quality assurance, treatment delivery, and follow-up assessment [(Liu et al., 2023)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667005423000479). Use-cases for AI-based tooling can be found across this entire spectrum, especially in image segmentation, treatment planning, quality assurance, and outcome prediction [(Barragan-Montero et al., 2022)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6560/ac678a/pdf). These tools are reshaping traditional paradigms in radiation oncology and medical physics by automating labor-intensive tasks while maintaining or even improving quality standards [(Wang et al., 2019)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1533033819873922).

AI applications in radiation oncology can be broadly categorized into two key areas. First, in the practical aspects of radiation planning and delivery, where image analysis algorithms can automate tumor and normal tissue segmentation, and ML models can develop treatment plans based on prior cases. Second, these systems can provide quality assurance and remote review services for treatment plans [(Thomas et al., 2020)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32305726/). Deep learning approaches have demonstrated particular promise for contouring organs at risk (OARs) in head and neck cancer treatment planning, achieving high accuracy while reducing clinical workload [(Lastrucci et al., 2024)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11083654/) [(Liu et al., 2023)](https://biomedical-engineering-online.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12938-023-01159-y).

Treatment planning, in particular, has become increasingly sophisticated but also more labor intensive, often requiring hours or days of planner effort to optimize an individual case [(Wang et al., 2019)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1533033819873922). AI algorithms can automate and improve this process, focusing on automated planning and optimizing dosimetric trade-offs, which positively impacts both planning efficiency and consistency in plan quality [(Jones et al., 2023)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/jmrs.729).

AI techniques are especially promising for online treatment planning and adaptive radiotherapy [(Boon et al., 2018)](https://www.mdpi.com/2305-6320/5/4/131). They can provide fast reconstruction of CT or MR images, generate CT-like images from MRI for dose calculations, and enable autocontouring of organs at risk and tumors [(Fiorino et al., 2020)](https://febs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/1878-0261.12659). Deep learning methods, particularly convolutional neural networks, have shown superior performance in these applications [(Sahiner et al., 2018)](https://aapm.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/mp.13264).

Beyond these technical applications, AI has the potential to standardize and improve clinical practice by mitigating variability and suboptimality related to human factors [(Wang et al., 2020)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fonc.2020.580919/pdf). It can also facilitate knowledge transfer from more experienced to less experienced centers, helping disseminate expertise in planning new or emerging treatments and supporting radiation oncology practice in developing countries [(Barragan-Montero et al., 2022)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6560/ac678a/pdf).

## Challenges and Opportunities

The integration of AI in radiation oncology extends beyond automating existing processes. It enables the analysis of multisource data that integrate variables from time-dependent sources, such as sequential quantitative imaging or genetic biomarkers. This capability could dramatically change radiotherapy approaches and play a central role in developing personalized, precision medicine [(Kazmierska et al., 2020)](https://www.thegreenjournal.com/article/S0167-8140(20)30829-X/pdf). 

The vision for AI in radiation oncology extends beyond targeted applications toward fully integrated data management systems with continuous feedback loops between patient outcomes and model inputs. This integration aims to improve clinical decision-making, enable accurate prediction of treatment outcomes and quality of life, and support efficient treatment planning and delivery [(Field et al., 2021)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34307915/). Recent innovations include foundation models like RO-LMM, which demonstrate proficiency across multiple tasks in the radiation oncology workflow, including clinical report summarization, treatment plan suggestion, and 3D target volume segmentation [(Kim et al., 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15876). The Radiation Oncology NLP Database (ROND) is the first dedicated NLP dataset for the specialty, which has historically received limited attention from the NLP community [(Liu et al., 2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10995). As NLP technology matures, its integration into clinical settings can focus on high-priority tasks and contribute to assembling clinical corpora with appropriate guidelines and performance metrics [(Lin et al., 2024)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10874185/). 

Despite these advances, it's important to recognize that AI currently excels at replicating, automating, and standardizing human behavior on manual tasks, while conceptual clinical challenges related to definition, evaluation, and judgment remain in the realm of human intelligence [(Jarrett et al., 2019)](https://academic.oup.com/bjr/article/92/1100/20190001/7449195?login=true). Significant challenges therefore remain in implementing AI solutions in radiation oncology. These include the complexity of patient-specific disease characteristics, interplay with systemic therapies, inconsistent data recording methods, and limitations in treatment outcome reporting [(Field et al., 2021)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34307915/). Studies often lack information about the confidence levels associated with AI predictions and rarely assess how these technologies impact clinical outcomes [(Lastrucci et al., 2024)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11083654/)[(Franzese et al., 2023)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10301548/). The full potential of AI in radiation oncology and medical physics will require addressing challenges related to data privacy, bias, and the continued need for human expertise [(Fionda et al., 2024)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39381628/)[(Alowais et al., 2023)](https://bmcmededuc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12909-023-04698-z).

The successful integration of AI into radiation oncology practice will require interdisciplinary collaboration between radiation oncologists and computer scientists. Such partnerships are essential for aligning AI technologies with clinical needs, establishing acceptable performance metrics, and ensuring that developments address meaningful clinical problems [(Lin et al., 2024)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10874185/)[(Lastrucci et al., 2024)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11083654/). As these collaborative efforts progress, they have the potential to automate significant portions of the radiotherapy workflow, transforming this traditionally labor-intensive specialty.

## Historical Context and Evolution of AI

Artificial Intelligence as a field has roots dating back to the 1950s, but the concepts that would eventually lead to modern AI began much earlier with philosophical questions about the nature of knowledge, reasoning, and the possibility of creating thinking machines. The formal birth of AI as a discipline is often attributed to the Dartmouth Conference of 1956, where John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Claude Shannon, and others gathered to discuss the possibility of creating machines that could "think."

The early decades of AI research were characterized by periods of great optimism followed by "AI winters" when progress slowed and funding decreased. Early AI approaches focused on symbolic reasoning and rule-based systems, attempting to encode human knowledge explicitly. These systems showed promise in narrow domains but struggled with the complexity and ambiguity of real-world problems.

The evolution of AI has been marked by several paradigm shifts. From the rule-based expert systems of the 1970s and 1980s to the statistical approaches that gained prominence in the 1990s, each era brought new insights and techniques. The current deep learning revolution, which began in earnest around 2012 with breakthroughs in image recognition using convolutional neural networks, represents perhaps the most significant shift yet.

In radiation oncology, this evolution mirrors the broader field, with early applications focusing on rule-based planning systems, followed by statistical models for outcome prediction, and now deep learning approaches for tasks ranging from image segmentation to treatment planning optimization.

## Types of Machine Learning

Machine learning, a subset of AI, focuses on developing algorithms that can learn patterns from data without being explicitly programmed. The field is typically divided into several learning paradigms:

### Supervised Learning

Supervised learning involves training models on labeled data, where each input is paired with the desired output. The algorithm learns to map inputs to outputs by minimizing the difference between its predictions and the ground truth labels. This approach is particularly relevant in radiation oncology for tasks like tumor classification, where historical images with confirmed diagnoses serve as training data.

In supervised learning, the quality and quantity of labeled data are crucial factors in model performance. For medical applications, obtaining high-quality labeled data often requires expert annotation, which can be time-consuming and expensive. This challenge is particularly acute in radiation oncology, where inter-observer variability in contouring can introduce inconsistencies in training data.

Common supervised learning tasks include classification (assigning inputs to discrete categories) and regression (predicting continuous values). In radiation oncology, classification might involve determining whether tissue is cancerous, while regression could predict radiation dose distribution.

### Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data, seeking to discover inherent patterns or structures. Without explicit guidance on what constitutes a "correct" output, these algorithms identify natural groupings, reduce dimensionality, or detect anomalies in data.

Clustering algorithms, a major category of unsupervised learning, group similar data points together based on distance metrics. In radiation oncology, clustering might be used to identify patient subgroups with similar treatment responses or to detect patterns in treatment planning that correlate with outcomes.

Dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or t-SNE help visualize high-dimensional data and can reveal underlying structures not immediately apparent in the original feature space. These techniques can be valuable for analyzing the complex, multi-dimensional data generated in radiation treatment planning.

Anomaly detection algorithms identify outliers or unusual patterns in data, which could represent equipment malfunctions, unusual patient anatomy, or potential errors in treatment plans.

### Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning involves training agents to make sequences of decisions by rewarding desired behaviors and penalizing undesired ones. Unlike supervised learning, there are no labeled examples; instead, the agent learns through trial and error, guided by a reward signal.

This paradigm has shown promise in treatment planning optimization, where the algorithm can learn to generate plans that maximize tumor coverage while minimizing dose to organs at risk. The reward function in such applications might incorporate clinical objectives like dose constraints and target coverage metrics.

Reinforcement learning faces challenges in medical applications due to the need for extensive exploration (trying different actions to learn their outcomes), which may not be feasible in clinical settings where patient safety is paramount. Simulation environments and digital twins offer potential solutions, allowing algorithms to learn in virtual environments before deployment in clinical practice.

### Semi-supervised and Self-supervised Learning

Semi-supervised learning combines elements of supervised and unsupervised learning, using a small amount of labeled data alongside a larger pool of unlabeled data. This approach is particularly relevant in medical imaging, where expert annotations may be limited but unannotated images are abundant.

Self-supervised learning, a growing area of research, involves creating supervised learning tasks from unlabeled data by generating labels automatically. For example, an algorithm might be trained to predict missing portions of an image, with the complete image serving as the ground truth. These approaches show promise for pre-training models when labeled data is scarce.

## Model Evaluation Basics

Proper evaluation is essential for understanding model performance and making informed decisions about deployment. Several key concepts underpin effective model evaluation:

### Train-Test Splits and Cross-Validation

Splitting data into training and testing sets allows evaluation on unseen data, providing a more realistic assessment of how the model will perform in practice. Cross-validation extends this concept by performing multiple train-test splits and averaging the results, providing a more robust performance estimate.

In medical applications with limited data, techniques like stratified k-fold cross-validation help ensure that important subgroups are represented in both training and testing sets. Leave-one-out cross-validation, where each sample serves as the test set once, can be appropriate for very small datasets.

### Overfitting and Underfitting

Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise rather than the underlying pattern. This results in poor generalization to new data. Underfitting, conversely, happens when a model is too simple to capture the underlying pattern.

Regularization techniques, early stopping, and proper validation can help detect and mitigate overfitting. In radiation oncology, where datasets are often small, the risk of overfitting is particularly high, making these techniques especially important.

### Performance Metrics

Different metrics capture different aspects of model performance:

- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correct predictions, useful for balanced classification problems.
- **Precision and Recall**: Important for imbalanced problems, precision measures the proportion of positive predictions that are correct, while recall measures the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified.
- **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two.
- **Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC)**: Measures the model's ability to discriminate between classes across different threshold settings.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Common metrics for regression problems.

In radiation oncology, domain-specific metrics are often more relevant than generic ones. For contouring tasks, metrics like Dice similarity coefficient and Hausdorff distance measure the overlap and maximum distance between predicted and ground truth contours. For treatment planning, metrics might include target coverage, conformity indices, and dose to organs at risk.
