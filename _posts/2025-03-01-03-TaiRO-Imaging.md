| Modality     | Typical Uses                                                                 | Duration             | Pros                                                                 | Cons                                                                   |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| X-ray        | Fracture diagnosis; Lung infection detection; Dental evaluation              | 10–15 minutes        | Quick and accessible; Relatively low cost; Effective for detecting fractures and lung conditions | Limited soft tissue detail; Exposure to ionizing radiation             |
| Fluoroscopy  | Barium enema procedures; Cardiac catheterization; Joint injections           | 30 minutes – 2 hours | Real-time imaging; Guidance during procedures                        | Exposure to ionizing radiation; Potential for contrast dye reactions   |
| CT Scan      | Tumor detection and staging; Vascular disease evaluation; Internal injury assessment | 20–25 minutes        | High-resolution images; Fast scanning times; Excellent for bone and vascular evaluation | Higher radiation dose than X-rays; Contrast dye may be required        |
| MRI          | Brain and spinal cord imaging; Soft tissue evaluation; Multiple sclerosis diagnosis | 45 minutes – 1 hour  | Detailed soft tissue images; No ionizing radiation; Multiplanar imaging capabilities | Longer scanning times; Claustrophobic for some patients; Limited availability for certain conditions |
| Ultrasound   | Prenatal imaging and monitoring; Abdominal and pelvic evaluation; Cardiac and vascular imaging | 30 minutes – 1 hour  | Real-time imaging; No ionizing radiation; Safe for pregnant women     | Operator-dependent; Limited penetration for deep structures            |
| PET Scan     | Cancer diagnosis and staging; Brain function evaluation; Heart disease assessment | 1.5 – 2 hours        | Functional and metabolic information; Detection of small lesions; Accurate staging of cancers | High cost; Limited availability; Requires radiotracer administration   |
| Mammography  | Breast cancer screening; Detection of breast abnormalities                   | 30 minutes           | Early detection of breast cancer; High-resolution images              | Slight discomfort during the procedure                                |

1. X-Ray
How it works: Uses ionizing radiation to produce 2D images of the body.
Use cases: Bone fractures, lung infections (like pneumonia), chest imaging, dental exams.
Speed: Very fast (few minutes).
Cost: Low.
Radiation: Low dose.
Limitations: Poor soft tissue contrast; overlapping structures can obscure details.

1. CT (Computed Tomography)
How it works: Combines X-ray images taken from different angles into cross-sectional views.
Use cases: Trauma, cancer, stroke, internal bleeding.
Speed: Fast (minutes).
Cost: Moderate to high.
Radiation: Higher than X-ray (can be 100–1,000 times more).
Strengths: Great for bone, chest, and detecting bleeding.
Limitations: High radiation; contrast dye may affect kidneys.

1. MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)
How it works: Uses magnets and radio waves to produce detailed images of soft tissues.
Use cases: Brain, spinal cord, muscles, joints, tumors.
Speed: Slower (30–90 minutes).
Cost: High.
Radiation: None.
Strengths: Best soft tissue contrast; no radiation.
Limitations: Claustrophobia, loud, not suitable with metal implants.

1. Ultrasound
How it works: High-frequency sound waves create real-time images.
Use cases: Pregnancy, abdomen, heart (echocardiogram), blood flow.
Speed: Real-time (immediate).
Cost: Low to moderate.
Radiation: None.
Strengths: Safe in pregnancy, portable, real-time imaging.
Limitations: Operator-dependent; limited by gas or obesity.

1. Nuclear Medicine (e.g., PET, SPECT)
How it works: Injects small amounts of radioactive material to assess function (not just structure).
Use cases: Cancer detection, heart disease, brain disorders.
Speed: Variable (can take hours).
Cost: High.
Radiation: Moderate to high (depends on tracer).
Strengths: Functional imaging; early disease detection.
Limitations: Radiation exposure; long prep and scan times.

"How tomographic reconstruction works?": [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0sxjhGHRPo) inspired by 3Blue1Brown shows how CT images are reconstructed in 3D using a series of single plane projections.

"Radiology Modalities Explained: Understanding Medical Imaging Techniques": [This article](https://ccdcare.com/resource-center/radiology-modalities/) includes an overview of various radiology modalities, including X-rays, CT scans, MRI, ultrasound, and nuclear medicine. It explains how each modality works, their diagnostic applications, and considerations regarding radiation exposure.
