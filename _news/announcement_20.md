:scroll: Our paper "AutoDoseRank: Automated Dosimetry-Informed Segmentation Ranking for Radiotherapy" is accepted at the CaPTion@MICCAI Workshop. This is special as it is Zahiras (master advisee) first first-author paper. She also goes on to win the CAIM Research Award in the Translation category for her contributions to ContourAid. Way to go, Zahira!
