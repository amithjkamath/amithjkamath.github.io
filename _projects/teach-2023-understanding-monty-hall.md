An interactive MATLAB application that teaches conditional probability through the famous Monty Hall problem, transforming a counterintuitive mathematical concept into an engaging, hands-on learning experience.

**Educational Focus:** Conditional Probability, Game Theory, Interactive Learning

## Educational Challenge

Traditional mathematics lectures often struggle with counterintuitive concepts like conditional probability. The Monty Hall problem presents a perfect case study where:

- **Intuitive Logic Fails**: Most students incorrectly assume 50/50 probability
- **Abstract Theory**: Mathematical proofs can feel disconnected from reality
- **Cognitive Resistance**: Students resist accepting the correct answer without experiential evidence
- **Teaching Opportunity**: Interactive gameplay can demonstrate mathematical truths

## Key Features

### Interactive Gameplay
- **Three-Door Interface**: Classic Monty Hall setup with visual feedback
- **Real-Time Statistics**: Track win/loss ratios for different strategies
- **Immediate Feedback**: See results of switching vs. staying decisions
- **Multiple Rounds**: Build statistical evidence through repeated gameplay

### Educational Value
- **Computational Proof**: Demonstrate probability through large-sample simulation
- **Strategy Comparison**: Quantitatively compare "stay" vs. "switch" strategies
- **Visual Learning**: Intuitive interface reduces cognitive load
- **Self-Discovery**: Students reach conclusions through experimentation

## Technical Implementation

**Platform**: MATLAB App Designer for cross-platform compatibility  
**Interface**: User-friendly GUI with door animations and statistics tracking  
**Algorithm**: Monte Carlo simulation for probability demonstration  
**Visualization**: Real-time graphical updates of win/loss statistics

## Learning Outcomes

Students who use this application will:
- **Understand Conditional Probability**: See how additional information changes probabilities
- **Appreciate Statistical Evidence**: Learn the value of large sample sizes
- **Overcome Cognitive Bias**: Experience the counterintuitive nature of probability
- **Connect Theory to Practice**: Bridge abstract mathematics with interactive experience

## Impact on Mathematics Education

This tool addresses the critical need for **making abstract mathematics tangible and engaging**:

- **Active Learning**: Students participate rather than passively observe
- **Evidence-Based Understanding**: Repeated trials build statistical conviction  
- **Immediate Gratification**: Real-time feedback maintains engagement
- **Memorable Experience**: Interactive learning creates lasting understanding

The application demonstrates how **computational tools can transform mathematical education**, making previously difficult concepts accessible through experiential learning.
