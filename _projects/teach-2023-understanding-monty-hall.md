Mathematics lectures can often be dry and boring - especially when the results are not intuitive, or even counter intuitive. For this reason, introducing concepts like conditional probability using a game - called the Monty Hall problem - is a good example of how instructors could "make learning Math great again".

This project creates a MATLAB App which allows an interactive gameplay of the three-door or Monty Hall problem, and showcases how one could computationally "prove" the otherwise hard to understand result of probabilities changing when doors are opened.

See [Here](https://github.com/amithjkamath/montyhall) for the repository and the code that makes this possible.
