This research compares the performance of radiation oncologists with deep learning-based dose prediction models for estimating the dosimetric impact of segmentation variations in brain tumor radiotherapy planning.

**Published at:** Medical Imaging with Deep Learning Conference (MIDL) 2024 *(Oral - 18% acceptance rate)*  
**Extended Journal:** Radiotherapy and Oncology (Green Journal) 2025

## Clinical Problem

Current segmentation quality evaluation in radiotherapy relies primarily on **geometric correctness metrics** that fail to capture the true **clinical consequences** of segmentation variations. This creates a significant gap between quality assessment and actual treatment impact, where:

- Geometry-driven metrics cannot characterize potentially detrimental dosimetric effects
- Manual expert evaluation is time-intensive and shows high inter-evaluator variability  
- Clinical decision-making lacks quantitative dose-based feedback
- Automated segmentation tools require clinically meaningful quality assessment

## Key Innovations

### MIDL 2024 Study
The study represents the first systematic comparison of deep learning dose prediction with clinical expert assessment, introducing novel dosimetric quality metrics based on actual dose impact rather than geometric similarity. The research included clinical validation with 54 contour variants across brain tumor treatment planning scenarios and quantified efficiency analysis measuring time savings and accuracy improvements.

### Extended Journal Study
The extended study included a large-scale survey involving 4 radiation oncologists and 3 medical physicists, with comprehensive inter-evaluator analysis investigating clinical decision-making variability. The research encompassed systematic evaluation of 54 glioblastoma target volume variations across 14 patients and included decision pattern analysis to understand expert assessment inconsistencies.

## Methodology

**Deep Learning Pipeline**: Trained dose prediction model on clinical treatment planning data  
**Expert Evaluation**: Systematic assessment by experienced radiation oncologists and medical physicists  
**Ground Truth Validation**: Standardized treatment plans generated using clinical TPS (Eclipse)  
**Statistical Analysis**: Cohen's Kappa for inter-evaluator agreement, correlation analysis

## Key Results

### MIDL 2024 Findings
The study showed that the deep learning model demonstrated superior performance by outperforming clinical experts in estimating dosimetric impact, with accuracy improvement showing higher correlation with ground truth dose distributions. The automated approach provided significant time savings compared to manual expert review and achieved consistent evaluation with reduced variability compared to human experts.

### Extended Journal Results
The extended study revealed substantial variability in expert assessment with Cohen's Kappa values ranging from weak to moderate (0.33â€“0.74). The results showed systematic overestimation, with 46% of "no change" variations misclassified as "worse", and conservative bias where no evaluator identified any contour variations as "better" despite 4 cases being objectively better. This led to clinical inefficiency with potential for unnecessary contour corrections due to overestimation.

## Clinical Impact

This research provides compelling evidence for integrating **AI-based dose prediction** into radiotherapy quality assurance workflows by offering objective assessment through quantitative, dose-based evaluation replacing subjective geometric metrics. The approach improves workflow efficiency with automated assessment that reduces review time and clinical burden, while providing improved consistency through standardized evaluation that reduces inter-evaluator variability. The system enhances safety with more accurate identification of clinically significant segmentation errors and offers cost-effectiveness through reduced unnecessary corrections and improved resource utilization.
