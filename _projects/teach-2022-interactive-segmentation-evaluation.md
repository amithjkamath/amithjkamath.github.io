An interactive MATLAB application that teaches image segmentation evaluation metrics through hands-on boundary drawing and real-time quality assessment against ground truth references.

**Educational Focus:** Image Segmentation, Quality Metrics, Computer Vision Fundamentals

## Educational Motivation

Image segmentation is fundamental to computer vision and medical imaging, but understanding quality metrics can be abstract without hands-on experience:

- **Metric Complexity**: Students struggle to understand Dice coefficient, Hausdorff distance, and pixel accuracy conceptually
- **Practical Disconnect**: Gap between mathematical formulas and real-world application
- **Expert Variability**: Need to understand inter-observer agreement and segmentation quality
- **Clinical Relevance**: Connection between segmentation accuracy and downstream applications

## Key Features

### Interactive Drawing Interface
- **Real-Time Segmentation**: Draw boundaries directly on target images
- **Multiple Objects**: Practice with various anatomical structures and objects
- **Instant Feedback**: See quality metrics update as you draw
- **Ground Truth Comparison**: Visual overlay of reference segmentations

### Comprehensive Metrics
- **Dice Score Coefficient**: Overlap-based similarity measure
- **Hausdorff Distance**: Maximum distance between boundary points  
- **Pixel Accuracy**: Point-wise classification correctness
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded overlays showing agreement/disagreement

### Educational Scaffolding
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Start with simple shapes, advance to complex anatomical structures
- **Immediate Assessment**: Real-time feedback on segmentation quality
- **Multiple Attempts**: Practice and improve segmentation accuracy
- **Comparative Analysis**: See how different drawing approaches affect metrics

## Technical Implementation

**Platform**: MATLAB with interactive UI components  
**Input Methods**: Mouse-based boundary drawing with curve smoothing  
**Metric Calculations**: Real-time computation of standard segmentation quality measures  
**Visualization**: Multi-color overlays for intuitive quality assessment

## Learning Outcomes

Students using this tool will:
- **Master Segmentation Metrics**: Understand how different quality measures respond to boundary variations
- **Develop Practical Skills**: Gain experience in manual segmentation techniques
- **Appreciate Quality Trade-offs**: See how speed vs. accuracy affects different metrics
- **Connect Theory to Practice**: Bridge mathematical concepts with visual understanding

## Applications in Education

### Computer Vision Courses
- **Fundamental Concepts**: Introduction to segmentation and evaluation metrics
- **Practical Exercises**: Hands-on experience with real evaluation scenarios
- **Metric Comparison**: Understand when different quality measures are appropriate

### Medical Imaging Training
- **Clinical Relevance**: Practice with anatomical structures and medical images
- **Quality Standards**: Understand acceptable segmentation quality for clinical applications
- **Inter-Observer Studies**: Experience the challenge of consistent manual segmentation

### Deep Learning Education
- **Loss Function Understanding**: See how segmentation metrics translate to training objectives
- **Performance Evaluation**: Learn standard evaluation protocols for segmentation models
- **Quality Assessment**: Develop intuition for model performance evaluation

## Impact on Understanding

This interactive approach transforms abstract mathematical concepts into **tangible, visual experiences**:

- **Immediate Feedback**: Students see the impact of their decisions in real-time
- **Experiential Learning**: Understanding develops through practice rather than memorization  
- **Metric Intuition**: Visual feedback builds understanding of what metrics actually measure
- **Practical Skills**: Students develop real segmentation and evaluation capabilities
