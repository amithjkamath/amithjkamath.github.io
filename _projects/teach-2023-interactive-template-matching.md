## What It Does

Find Waldo by manually sliding his template across cluttered scenes. Watch correlation values update in real-time to understand how template matching algorithms detect objects.

**Key Features**: Interactive sliding, real-time correlation heatmaps, progressive difficulty levels

## Why It Matters

Template matching is fundamental to computer vision. This hands-on demo makes abstract correlation concepts tangible—drag the template and immediately see how mathematical similarity translates to visual object detection.

## What You'll Learn

- Sliding window search strategies
- Correlation as a similarity measure
- Algorithm limitations (rotation, scale, lighting)
- Foundation for understanding CNNs and modern detection methods

**Built with**: Streamlit, OpenCV | [View source code](https://huggingface.co/spaces/amithjkamath/template-matching/tree/main)
