## Overview

[![Project Repository](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Repository-blue?style=flat-square&logo=github)](https://github.com/amithjkamath/template-matching)

An interactive MATLAB application that teaches template matching concepts through a fun "Where's Waldo" style game, allowing students to understand correlation-based object detection through hands-on exploration.

**Educational Focus:** Template Matching, Correlation Analysis, Computer Vision Fundamentals

## Educational Motivation

Template matching is a fundamental computer vision technique, but students often struggle with:

- **Abstract Correlation Concepts**: Mathematical correlation functions can seem disconnected from visual results
- **Sliding Window Understanding**: Difficulty visualizing how templates move across images
- **Parameter Sensitivity**: Unclear how template size and matching thresholds affect performance
- **Practical Applications**: Limited understanding of when template matching is appropriate

## Key Features

### Interactive "Waldo" Detection
- **Manual Sliding**: Physically slide Waldo template across cluttered scenes
- **Real-Time Correlation**: See correlation values update as template moves
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded correlation matrix shows matching strength
- **Peak Detection**: Identify correlation maxima corresponding to Waldo locations

### Educational Visualization
- **Correlation Heatmap**: Visual representation of matching strength across the image
- **Template Overlay**: See exactly where the template is being compared
- **Score Display**: Numerical correlation values for quantitative understanding
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Multiple scenes with varying complexity

### Algorithm Understanding
- **Step-by-Step Process**: Watch the sliding window approach in action
- **Correlation Computation**: Understand how similarity is mathematically calculated
- **Threshold Effects**: Experiment with different detection thresholds
- **False Positive Analysis**: See how clutter affects detection performance

## Technical Implementation
