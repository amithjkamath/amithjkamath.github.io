## Overview

[![Project Repository](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Repository-blue?style=flat-square&logo=github)](https://github.com/amithjkamath/template-matching)

An interactive MATLAB application that teaches template matching concepts through a fun "Where's Waldo" style game, allowing students to understand correlation-based object detection through hands-on exploration.

**Educational Focus:** Template Matching, Correlation Analysis, Computer Vision Fundamentals

## Educational Motivation

Template matching is a fundamental computer vision technique, but students often struggle with abstract correlation concepts where mathematical correlation functions can seem disconnected from visual results. Students also have difficulty with sliding window understanding and visualizing how templates move across images, parameter sensitivity regarding how template size and matching thresholds affect performance, and practical applications with limited understanding of when template matching is appropriate.

## Key Features

### Interactive "Waldo" Detection
The system allows students to manually slide the Waldo template across cluttered scenes while seeing real-time correlation values update as the template moves. Visual feedback through color-coded correlation matrix shows matching strength, and peak detection helps identify correlation maxima corresponding to Waldo locations.

### Educational Visualization
The tool provides a correlation heatmap offering visual representation of matching strength across the image, template overlay showing exactly where the template is being compared, score display with numerical correlation values for quantitative understanding, and progressive difficulty through multiple scenes with varying complexity.

### Algorithm Understanding
Students can observe the step-by-step process watching the sliding window approach in action, understand correlation computation and how similarity is mathematically calculated, experiment with threshold effects and different detection thresholds, and conduct false positive analysis to see how clutter affects detection performance.

## Technical Implementation

**Platform**: MATLAB with intuitive drag-and-drop interface  
**Real-Time Processing**: Efficient correlation computation for smooth interaction  
**Visual Design**: Game-like interface maintains student engagement  
**Educational Scaffolding**: Progressive complexity builds understanding

## Learning Outcomes

Students using this tool will master template matching by understanding sliding window correlation methodology, develop algorithm intuition by seeing how mathematical operations translate to object detection, appreciate limitations by understanding when template matching works well and when it fails, and connect to modern methods by building foundation for understanding advanced object detection.

## Applications in Computer Vision Education

### Fundamental Concepts
The tool supports object detection basics through introduction to finding objects in images, correlation analysis with practical application of mathematical correlation, and feature matching as foundation for more advanced feature detection methods.
