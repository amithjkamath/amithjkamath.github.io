## What It Does

Manipulate affine transformation parameters with interactive sliders and see how rotation, translation, scaling, and shearing affect medical images in real-time.

**Key Features**: Real-time parameter control, grid overlays for spatial reference, medical imaging examples (CT, MRI, X-ray)

## Why It Matters

Image registration aligns images from different time points, modalities, or orientations—critical for medical imaging. This demo makes abstract transformation matrices tangible by connecting parameter adjustments directly to visual deformations.

## What You'll Learn

- Affine transformations and matrix representations
- How rotation, translation, scaling, and shearing compose
- Clinical applications: multi-modal fusion, longitudinal studies, surgical planning
- Foundation for non-rigid registration and deep learning methods

**Built with**: Streamlit, medical imaging support | [View source code](https://huggingface.co/spaces/amithjkamath/image-registration/tree/main)
