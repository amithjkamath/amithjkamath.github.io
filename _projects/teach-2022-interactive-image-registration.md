## Overview

[![Project Repository](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Repository-blue?style=flat-square&logo=github)](https://github.com/amithjkamath/image-registration)

An interactive MATLAB application that teaches image registration concepts by allowing real-time manipulation of affine transformation parameters with immediate visual feedback on image deformation.

**Educational Focus:** Image Registration, Affine Transformations, Medical Image Analysis

## Educational Challenge

Image registration is a foundational concept in medical image analysis, but students often struggle with:

- **Abstract Mathematics**: Transformation matrices can feel disconnected from visual results
- **Parameter Understanding**: Unclear how individual parameters affect image deformation
- **Clinical Relevance**: Difficulty connecting mathematical concepts to medical applications
- **Spatial Intuition**: Limited understanding of rotation, translation, scaling, and shearing effects

## Key Features

### Real-Time Parameter Control
- **Interactive Sliders**: Modify each affine transformation matrix element independently
- **Immediate Feedback**: See image deformation in real-time as parameters change
- **Parameter Isolation**: Understand individual effects of rotation, translation, scaling, shearing
- **Reset Functionality**: Return to original state and try different transformations

### Educational Visualization
- **Before/After Comparison**: Side-by-side view of original and transformed images
- **Grid Overlay**: Visual reference for understanding spatial deformations
- **Parameter Display**: Current transformation matrix values shown clearly
- **Progressive Learning**: Build understanding through incremental parameter changes

### Practical Applications
- **Medical Image Examples**: Use realistic medical imaging data for relevance
- **Common Scenarios**: Demonstrate typical registration challenges and solutions
- **Multi-Modal Registration**: Show different imaging modality alignment scenarios

## Technical Implementation

**Platform**: MATLAB with interactive GUI components  
**Real-Time Processing**: Efficient affine transformation computation for smooth interaction  
**Visual Feedback**: Optimized rendering for immediate parameter response  
**Educational Design**: Interface optimized for learning rather than production use

## Learning Outcomes

Students using this tool will:
- **Master Affine Transformations**: Understand how matrix elements control image deformation
- **Develop Spatial Intuition**: Build visual understanding of geometric transformations
- **Connect Theory to Practice**: See immediate results of mathematical operations
- **Prepare for Advanced Topics**: Build foundation for non-rigid registration and advanced techniques

## Applications in Curriculum

### Medical Image Analysis Courses
- **Registration Fundamentals**: Introduction to spatial alignment concepts
- **Preprocessing Understanding**: Learn why registration is essential for image analysis
- **Parameter Sensitivity**: Understand how small changes affect registration quality

### Computer Vision Education
- **Geometric Transformations**: Practical experience with fundamental CV concepts

- **Image Processing Pipeline**: Understand registration's role in broader image analysis

### Mathematical Visualization
- **Linear Algebra Applications**: See abstract mathematics applied to real data
- **Matrix Operations**: Visual demonstration of matrix multiplication effects
- **Geometric Understanding**: Connect algebraic operations to geometric transformations

## Clinical Context

The tool emphasizes the **medical relevance** of image registration:

- **Multi-Time Point Studies**: Align images from different time points for disease progression analysis
- **Multi-Modal Fusion**: Combine information from different imaging modalities (CT, MRI, PET)
- **Surgical Planning**: Align preoperative images with intraoperative guidance systems
- **Population Studies**: Register individual patients to standard anatomical atlases

## Impact on Learning

This hands-on approach transforms **abstract mathematical concepts into intuitive understanding**:

- **Experiential Learning**: Students learn through direct manipulation rather than passive observation
- **Immediate Gratification**: Real-time feedback maintains engagement and motivation
- **Visual Intuition**: Students develop spatial reasoning for transformation effects
- **Practical Preparation**: Skills directly transfer to real medical image analysis workflows
