## Technical Tutorial: Step-by-Step Implementation

### 1. Environment Setup

**Create MATLAB-Compatible Python Environment:**
```bash
conda create --name matlab-env python=3.9
conda activate matlab-env
which python  # Note this path for MATLAB configuration
```

**Install Required Dependencies:**
```bash
conda install pytorch torchvision
pip install monai
```

### 2. MATLAB-Python Interface Configuration

**Configure Python Environment in MATLAB:**
```matlab
% Set Python executable path (adjust for your system)
pyversion('/Users/amithkamath/opt/anaconda3/envs/matlab-env/bin/python')

% Verify configuration
pe = pyenv;
disp(pe)
```

### 3. Model Loading and Execution

**Load Pre-trained MONAI Model:**
```matlab
% Import necessary Python modules
torch = py.importlib.import_module('torch');
monai = py.importlib.import_module('monai');

% Load trained model
model = torch.load('path/to/monai_model.pth');
model.eval();
```

**Process Medical Images:**
```matlab
% Load and preprocess medical image data
input_data = prepare_medical_image(image_path);

% Run inference
with py.torch.no_grad()
    output = model(input_data);
end

% Convert results back to MATLAB format
segmentation_result = double(output.numpy());
```

## Best Practices and Troubleshooting

### Memory Management
- Use `py.torch.no_grad()` for inference to reduce memory consumption
- Clear Python variables when processing large datasets
- Monitor memory usage across both MATLAB and Python environments

### Error Handling
```matlab
try
    % MONAI model execution
    result = run_monai_model(input_data);
catch ME
    % Handle cross-platform errors gracefully
    fprintf('Error in Python execution: %s\n', ME.message);
    % Fallback or error recovery logic
end
```

### Performance Optimization
- Pre-allocate MATLAB arrays for output data
- Minimize data type conversions between platforms
- Use batch processing for multiple images
