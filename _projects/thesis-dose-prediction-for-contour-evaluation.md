## Introduction and Clinical Context

Radiation therapy requires precise contouring to target tumors while sparing healthy tissues. Traditional geometric metrics for segmentation quality often fail to reflect clinical relevance, as minor errors in critical regions can significantly impact dose delivery. Dose prediction models address this by evaluating contours based on their dosimetric consequences, leveraging AI to enhance clinical validation, reduce inter-observer variability, and support personalized quality assurance.

## The Paradigm Shift: From Geometric to Dosimetric Assessment

### Limitations of Traditional Geometric Metrics

Geometric metrics like Dice Similarity Coefficient assume uniform spatial importance, ignoring dose gradients and clinical context. They show limited correlation with outcomes like tumor control, often misguiding quality assurance efforts.

### The Clinical Imperative for Dose-Aware Assessment

Dosimetric assessment prioritizes clinical outcomes, adapting to treatment techniques and patient-specific risks. It optimizes resource allocation by focusing on dosimetrically critical errors, enhancing treatment efficacy.

### Theoretical Foundations of Dose Prediction

Dose prediction models must balance radiation physics, spatial-dosimetric relationships, and uncertainty propagation. Machine learning frameworks address these non-linear interactions, ensuring clinical relevance and computational efficiency.

## Automated Contour Quality Assurance Frameworks

### Traditional Approaches and Their Limitations

Traditional systems using outlier detection and geometric metrics [(Altman et al., 2015)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26083863/) struggle with clinical irrelevance and lack adaptability, failing to prioritize dosimetrically significant errors.

### Modern Deep Learning-Based Systems

CNN-based systems achieve high accuracy (80-99%) for head and neck structures [(Rhee et al., 2019)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31505046/). Multi-modal integration and uncertainty quantification enhance clinical utility, though complexity increases.

### Integration Challenges and Solutions

Integration requires robust APIs, standardized data exchange, and intuitive interfaces. Clinical studies show AI contours reduce manual time by 90% [(Jin et al., 2022)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39036546/), but user training and workflow alignment are critical.

## Dose Prediction Models for Quality Assessment

### Architectural Considerations

3D U-Net architectures excel in dose prediction, balancing detail and efficiency [(Kamath et al., 2023)](% cite kamath2023sensitivitydoseprediction %). Attention mechanisms and physics-informed designs improve accuracy and interpretability.

### Training Methodologies and Data Requirements

Training demands standardized, multi-institutional datasets and specialized augmentation to preserve dosimetric consistency. DVH-based loss functions enhance clinical relevance.

### Validation and Performance Metrics

Metrics like gamma analysis and DVH comparisons assess accuracy, while sensitivity analysis ensures detection of clinically significant errors. Clinical validation confirms practical utility.

Scalable GPU-based systems integrate with treatment planning databases via APIs [(Mashayekhi et al., 2023)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36968578/). Data security ensures HIPAA compliance.

### Workflow Integration Strategies

Dose prediction supports real-time feedback, post-contouring review, and adaptive radiotherapy, streamlining workflows [(Kerf et al., 2023)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37809056/).

### User Interface and Clinical Decision Support

Interfaces offer dose overlays, uncertainty visualization, and prioritized recommendations, enhancing decision-making and adoption.

## Current Challenges and Limitations

### Technical and Methodological Challenges

Generalization across institutions, computational demands, and handling rare cases remain barriers. Robust uncertainty quantification and physics consistency are critical.

### Clinical Adoption Barriers

Integration complexity, trust calibration, and training needs hinder adoption. Cost-benefit analyses and liability concerns require further study.

### Regulatory and Quality Assurance Considerations

Evolving regulatory frameworks and validation standards complicate approval. Data standardization and post-market surveillance are essential.
