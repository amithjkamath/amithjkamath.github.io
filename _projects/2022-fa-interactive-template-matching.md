Template Matching is a simple method where the location of a template in a scene is computed by sliding it all across the scene and computing a similarity. 

[Here](https://github.com/amithjkamath/template-matching) is a simple UI that allows you to literally slide 'Waldo', our protagonist across a cluttered scene where it is otherwise hard to find him, and learn how the correlation matrix is computed to then locate where he is. 

See [Here](https://github.com/amithjkamath/template-matching) for the repository and the code that makes this possible.
