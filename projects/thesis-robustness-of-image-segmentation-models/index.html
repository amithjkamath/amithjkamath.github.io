However, clinical deployment requires models that maintain reliability across the natural variability of real-world medical imaging: different scanning protocols, diverse patient populations, varied image quality, and evolving clinical practices. Our research investigates how fundamental architectural decisions in neural network design influence this robustness, with the goal of developing principled guidelines for building clinically reliable segmentation systems.</p> <p>This work examines the often-overlooked relationship between model architecture and performance stability. While much research focuses on maximizing accuracy on benchmark datasets, we explore how architectural choices affect a model’s ability to maintain performance when conditions deviate from training distributions. Understanding these relationships is crucial for developing segmentation systems that can be safely deployed in diverse clinical settings.</p> <h2 id="architectural-choices-and-their-clinical-implications">Architectural Choices and Their Clinical Implications</h2> <p>The U-Net architecture has become a foundational design for medical image segmentation, characterized by an encoder-decoder structure with skip connections that bridge corresponding levels of the network. These skip connections, which directly pass information from encoder to decoder layers, are widely believed to be essential for preserving fine-grained details necessary for accurate boundary delineation. However, the universal necessity of this design choice has received limited systematic investigation, particularly regarding how it affects model behavior under varying conditions.</p> <p>Our research challenges the assumption that architectural components beneficial for benchmark performance are universally optimal across all clinical scenarios. We examine how different architectural variations perform not just on standard test sets, but specifically on tasks with varying complexity and under different types of distribution shifts that commonly occur in clinical practice. This perspective reveals that optimal architectural choices may depend on the specific characteristics of the segmentation task and the expected deployment environment.</p> <p>The concept of task complexity provides a useful framework for understanding these relationships. Simple segmentation tasks involving clear anatomical boundaries and high contrast between structures may benefit from different architectural features than complex tasks involving subtle boundaries, overlapping structures, or low-contrast regions. By developing quantitative measures of task complexity, we can begin to understand which architectural features are most valuable in different clinical contexts.</p> <h2 id="investigating-skip-connections-across-task-complexity">Investigating Skip Connections Across Task Complexity</h2> <p>Skip connections represent one of the most widely adopted architectural innovations in medical image segmentation. The conventional understanding suggests they serve two critical functions: preserving spatial detail that might be lost in the encoding process, and providing gradient pathways that facilitate training of deep networks. However, our systematic investigation reveals a more nuanced picture of their impact <a class="citation" href="#Kamath2025SkipConnections">(Kamath et al., 2025)</a>.</p> <p>Through carefully controlled experiments across tasks of varying complexity, we found that skip connections provide clear benefits for simpler segmentation tasks where the mapping between input images and output segmentations follows relatively straightforward patterns. In these cases, the direct transfer of low-level features from encoder to decoder helps maintain precise boundary localization. However, for more complex tasks where the relationship between image appearance and semantic labels is more intricate, skip connections may inadvertently introduce misleading information that reduces model robustness.</p> <p>This complexity-dependent behavior has important practical implications. For clinical applications involving well-defined anatomical structures with clear boundaries, traditional U-Net architectures with skip connections remain strong choices. However, for challenging segmentation tasks involving subtle pathological features or complex anatomical relationships, alternative architectures that allow the network to learn more abstract representations without direct low-level feature transfer may prove more robust.</p> <p>Our findings also relate to the broader question of what features should be shared between encoder and decoder pathways. Skip connections implicitly assume that features useful for encoding the input image are equally useful for generating the segmentation output. While this assumption holds for many tasks, it may not be universal. Understanding when this assumption breaks down helps guide architectural design for specific clinical applications.</p> <h2 id="balancing-context-and-class-distribution-in-3d-segmentation">Balancing Context and Class Distribution in 3D Segmentation</h2> <p>Three-dimensional medical image segmentation presents unique challenges related to computational constraints and data characteristics. GPU memory limitations force practical trade-offs between the spatial extent of input volumes (which determines the anatomical context available to the model) and the sampling strategy used to balance class distributions during training. Our research investigated how different approaches to managing these trade-offs affect model robustness <a class="citation" href="#Kamath2023DoWe">(Kamath et al., 2023)</a>.</p> <p>We found that models generally benefit more from larger spatial context than from carefully balanced sampling of foreground and background regions. This finding suggests that the anatomical relationships and spatial patterns captured by wider fields of view provide more valuable information for segmentation than ensuring equal representation of different tissue types in each training sample. However, the relative importance of these factors varies across different architectural designs.</p> <p>Traditional convolutional architectures demonstrate greater resilience to imbalanced class distributions, maintaining performance even when the proportion of foreground pixels varies substantially from training conditions. This robustness is particularly valuable for clinical deployment, where the size and appearance of anatomical structures naturally vary across patients. In contrast, attention-based architectures, while potentially achieving higher peak performance under ideal conditions, show greater sensitivity to these distribution shifts.</p> <p>These findings provide practical guidance for model development and deployment. When designing systems for diverse clinical populations where anatomical variability is expected, prioritizing spatial context and selecting architectures with demonstrated robustness to class imbalance may be more important than optimizing for maximum benchmark performance. This perspective aligns with the broader goal of developing not just accurate models, but reliable systems that maintain acceptable performance across the full spectrum of clinical cases.</p> <h2 id="from-benchmark-performance-to-clinical-reliability">From Benchmark Performance to Clinical Reliability</h2> <p>The translation of segmentation algorithms from research settings to clinical practice requires rethinking how we evaluate and validate model performance. Traditional metrics focused on average accuracy across test sets, while informative, may not adequately capture the reliability characteristics essential for clinical deployment. Our research emphasizes the importance of evaluating model behavior under various perturbations and distribution shifts that mirror real-world variability.</p> <p>We have developed evaluation frameworks that systematically test model robustness across multiple dimensions: different levels of image noise, varying contrast characteristics, and domain shifts representing different scanning protocols or institutions. Statistical validation approaches help quantify not just average performance but also the consistency and predictability of model behavior. These more comprehensive evaluation strategies provide better indicators of how models will perform in actual clinical use.</p> <p>Beyond robustness evaluation, we have explored architectural innovations that explicitly optimize for reliability alongside accuracy. Multi-objective optimization approaches can balance traditional performance metrics with robustness criteria, potentially identifying architectural configurations that provide optimal trade-offs for specific clinical applications. Ensemble methods that combine predictions from multiple model variants may offer improved reliability, though at the cost of increased computational requirements.</p> <h2 id="toward-principled-clinical-deployment">Toward Principled Clinical Deployment</h2> <p>The insights from this research contribute to a set of emerging guidelines for developing clinically reliable segmentation systems. Architecture selection should consider not only benchmark performance but also the characteristics of the target application: task complexity, expected data variability, and the clinical consequences of different failure modes. For high-stakes applications where reliability is paramount, architectures demonstrating robust performance across varied conditions may be preferred even if they achieve slightly lower peak accuracy.</p> <p>Quality assurance frameworks should incorporate robustness assessments as routine components of model validation. Uncertainty quantification methods can help identify cases where model predictions may be less reliable, enabling appropriate human oversight. Continuous monitoring of model performance in deployment can detect distribution shifts or degradation over time, supporting adaptive quality assurance protocols.</p> <p>Looking forward, several promising directions emerge. Adaptive architectural designs that adjust their behavior based on input characteristics might provide both high performance and robust generalization. Foundation models trained on diverse medical imaging data could provide robust feature representations for downstream segmentation tasks. Continual learning approaches might enable models to maintain performance as clinical practices and imaging technologies evolve.</p> <p>The ultimate goal is to develop segmentation systems that clinicians can deploy with confidence, knowing they will maintain acceptable performance across the full diversity of patients and conditions encountered in practice. By understanding how architectural choices influence robustness and developing principled approaches to model design and validation, we can work toward this vision of truly reliable AI-assisted medical image analysis.</p> </article> <h2>References</h2> <div class="publications"> <h2 class="bibliography">2025</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> </div> <div id="Kamath2025SkipConnections" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">The impact of U-Net architecture choices and skip connections on the robustness of segmentation across texture variations</div> <div class="author"> <em>Amith Kamath</em>, Jonas Willmann, Nicolaus Andratschke, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 1 more author" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '1 more author' ?
