Central to this precision is the accurate delineation of anatomical structures through medical image segmentation—a process that forms the foundation for treatment planning, dose calculation, and ultimately, patient outcomes. The quality of these segmentations directly influences the success of radiation therapy, making their assessment a critical component of clinical quality assurance.</p> <p>The traditional paradigm for evaluating segmentation quality has relied predominantly on geometric metrics inherited from the broader computer vision community. These methods assess spatial overlap, boundary distances, and volumetric agreements between segmentations and reference standards. However, the unique clinical context of radiation therapy presents a fundamental challenge: geometric accuracy does not necessarily correlate with clinical relevance. A segmentation that exhibits poor geometric agreement with a reference standard may still result in an acceptable dose distribution, while subtle geometric variations in dosimetrically critical regions can have profound clinical consequences.</p> <p>This disconnect between geometric evaluation and clinical impact has catalyzed the development of dose prediction models for contour quality assessment—a paradigmatic shift that evaluates segmentations based on their downstream dosimetric consequences rather than their geometric properties alone. By incorporating artificial intelligence-driven dose prediction into quality assessment workflows, these approaches promise to bridge the gap between upstream segmentation evaluation and downstream clinical outcomes.</p> <p>The clinical implications of this research extend far beyond academic interest. As artificial intelligence and machine learning methods increasingly automate the segmentation process in radiation therapy, the need for clinically relevant validation frameworks becomes paramount. Traditional geometric metrics, while computationally efficient and easily interpretable, may provide false reassurance about segmentation quality or conversely flag acceptable variations as problematic. This misalignment between assessment methodology and clinical reality poses significant challenges for the safe and effective implementation of automated segmentation tools in clinical practice.</p> <p>Moreover, the field faces mounting evidence of substantial inter-observer variability in human contouring, even among expert practitioners following standardized guidelines. This variability is not uniform across anatomical structures or clinical contexts, with certain organs at risk showing consistently higher agreement than complex target volumes. Understanding these patterns and their dosimetric implications through dose prediction models is crucial for developing effective quality assurance protocols, training programs, and automated validation systems.</p> <p>The integration of dose prediction into segmentation evaluation also opens new avenues for personalized quality assurance approaches. Different patients, treatment techniques, and clinical scenarios may require different levels of segmentation precision in different anatomical regions. A dose prediction-based assessment framework could potentially guide adaptive quality assurance protocols that allocate human expert attention to the most dosimetrically critical aspects of each case, optimizing both clinical outcomes and resource utilization.</p> <p>Furthermore, dose prediction models offer the potential for real-time quality feedback during the contouring process itself. Rather than providing post-hoc evaluation, these systems could guide manual contouring decisions by providing immediate dosimetric impact assessments as structures are being delineated. This capability could significantly enhance the efficiency and accuracy of manual contouring while serving as a training tool for less experienced practitioners.</p> <p>The convergence of advancing computational capabilities, growing clinical demands for efficiency, and emerging evidence of traditional method limitations creates unprecedented opportunities for transforming segmentation quality assessment in radiation therapy. However, realizing this potential requires addressing significant challenges related to model development, validation, clinical integration, and regulatory approval—challenges that form the core focus of contemporary research in this rapidly evolving field.</p> <hr> <h2 id="the-paradigm-shift-from-geometric-to-dosimetric-assessment">The Paradigm Shift: From Geometric to Dosimetric Assessment</h2> <p>The evolution from geometric to dosimetric assessment of segmentation quality represents a fundamental reimagining of how we conceptualize and measure quality in medical image segmentation for radiation therapy. This paradigm shift is driven by growing recognition that traditional geometric metrics, while mathematically precise and computationally efficient, may not adequately capture the clinical significance of segmentation variations.</p> <h3 id="limitations-of-traditional-geometric-metrics">Limitations of Traditional Geometric Metrics</h3> <p>Traditional geometric metrics for segmentation evaluation have been extensively studied and widely adopted due to their intuitive interpretation and computational simplicity. However, several fundamental limitations have become increasingly apparent in the context of radiation therapy applications.</p> <p><strong>Spatial Uniformity Assumptions</strong>: Most geometric metrics implicitly assume that all spatial regions within a structure are equally important for quality assessment. The Dice Similarity Coefficient, for example, weights all voxels equally regardless of their location within the structure or their potential impact on dose distribution. In radiation therapy, however, different regions of the same structure may have vastly different dosimetric significance. The periphery of a planning target volume may be more critical for dose conformity than the central region, while the boundary between an organ at risk and the target volume may be more important than regions distant from radiation fields.</p> <p><strong>Independence from Clinical Context</strong>: Geometric metrics evaluate segmentation quality in isolation from the clinical context in which the segmentation will be used. A 2mm boundary error in a brainstem contour has vastly different clinical implications depending on whether the error occurs near a high-dose region or in an area receiving minimal radiation. Traditional metrics cannot distinguish between these scenarios, potentially leading to inappropriate resource allocation in quality assurance workflows.</p> <p><strong>Insensitivity to Dose Gradients</strong>: The clinical impact of segmentation errors is strongly influenced by local dose gradients and proximity to high-dose regions. Areas with steep dose gradients may be more sensitive to small geometric variations than regions with uniform dose distributions. Traditional geometric metrics do not incorporate this information, potentially overemphasizing errors in dosimetrically insignificant regions while underemphasizing critical errors in high-gradient areas.</p> <p><strong>Limited Correlation with Clinical Outcomes</strong>: Perhaps most importantly, studies have demonstrated weak or inconsistent correlations between traditional geometric metrics and clinical endpoints such as tumor control probability and normal tissue complication probability. This disconnect suggests that optimizing segmentation quality based solely on geometric criteria may not lead to optimal clinical outcomes.</p> <h3 id="the-clinical-imperative-for-dose-aware-assessment">The Clinical Imperative for Dose-Aware Assessment</h3> <p>The clinical practice of radiation therapy is fundamentally concerned with dose delivery and its biological consequences. Treatment planning, plan evaluation, and outcome assessment all center on dose-volume relationships and their implications for tumor control and toxicity. This clinical reality creates a compelling imperative for incorporating dosimetric considerations into segmentation quality assessment.</p> <p><strong>Dosimetric Impact Variability</strong>: Research has demonstrated that segmentation variations can produce widely varying dosimetric impacts depending on the specific anatomical location, treatment technique, and clinical scenario. A study examining inter-observer contouring variability found that geometric differences that appeared minimal could result in clinically significant dose variations to critical structures, while substantial geometric differences in other cases had negligible dosimetric impact.</p> <p><strong>Treatment Technique Sensitivity</strong>: Modern radiation therapy techniques such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), and stereotactic radiosurgery create complex dose distributions with steep gradients and high conformity indices. These techniques are particularly sensitive to segmentation accuracy in specific spatial regions, making traditional uniform geometric assessment inadequate for quality evaluation.</p> <p><strong>Risk-Adapted Assessment Needs</strong>: Different clinical scenarios require different levels of segmentation precision based on the associated risks and benefits. Palliative treatments may tolerate larger segmentation uncertainties than curative treatments, while re-irradiation cases may require exceptional precision due to cumulative dose constraints. A dose-aware assessment framework can adapt quality criteria to match clinical risk profiles.</p> <p><strong>Resource Optimization</strong>: Clinical quality assurance resources are inherently limited, requiring prioritization of review efforts based on potential clinical impact. Dose prediction models can guide this prioritization by identifying cases and structures where segmentation variations are most likely to affect clinical outcomes, enabling more efficient allocation of expert review time.</p> <h3 id="theoretical-foundations-of-dose-prediction">Theoretical Foundations of Dose Prediction</h3> <p>The development of effective dose prediction models for segmentation quality assessment requires a deep understanding of the underlying physics, mathematics, and computational challenges involved in radiation dose calculation and prediction.</p> <p><strong>Radiation Transport Physics</strong>: Accurate dose prediction must account for the fundamental physics of radiation transport, including photon attenuation, scatter, and energy deposition in heterogeneous media. While traditional treatment planning systems solve these problems using sophisticated algorithms such as Monte Carlo simulations or analytical approximations, dose prediction models must balance accuracy with computational efficiency to enable real-time quality assessment.</p> <p><strong>Spatial-Dosimetric Relationships</strong>: The relationship between spatial segmentation variations and resulting dose changes is highly non-linear and context-dependent. Small changes in segmentation boundaries can propagate through the treatment planning process in complex ways, potentially affecting beam angles, fluence patterns, and optimization objectives. Understanding and modeling these relationships requires sophisticated mathematical frameworks that can capture both local and global dosimetric effects.</p> <p><strong>Uncertainty Propagation</strong>: Segmentation uncertainties propagate through the treatment planning process in complex ways, interacting with uncertainties in patient setup, organ motion, and dose calculation algorithms. Effective dose prediction models must account for these uncertainty interactions to provide reliable quality assessments that support clinical decision-making under uncertainty.</p> <p><strong>Machine Learning Considerations</strong>: The application of machine learning to dose prediction presents unique challenges related to training data requirements, model generalization, and interpretability. Unlike traditional computer vision applications, dose prediction models must learn complex physical relationships while ensuring consistency with established radiation physics principles.</p> <p>The theoretical foundation for dose prediction-based quality assessment continues to evolve as researchers develop more sophisticated models and gain deeper understanding of the relationships between segmentation quality and clinical outcomes. This ongoing theoretical development is essential for creating robust, reliable, and clinically meaningful quality assessment frameworks.</p> <hr> <h2 id="automated-contour-quality-assurance-frameworks">Automated Contour Quality Assurance Frameworks</h2> <p>The implementation of automated segmentation in clinical radiation therapy has created an urgent need for robust, efficient, and clinically relevant quality assurance frameworks. Traditional manual review processes, while thorough, are resource-intensive and subject to the same inter-observer variability that affects initial contouring. Modern automated quality assurance systems offer the potential to address these limitations while providing more consistent and objective evaluation criteria.</p> <h3 id="traditional-approaches-and-their-limitations">Traditional Approaches and Their Limitations</h3> <p>Early automated quality assurance systems for medical image segmentation relied primarily on statistical outlier detection and geometric feature analysis. These approaches, while computationally efficient, suffer from fundamental limitations that have become increasingly apparent with clinical implementation.</p> <p><strong>Knowledge-Based Outlier Detection</strong>: One widely adopted approach uses one-class learning algorithms trained on features extracted from high-quality reference contours. These systems typically employ features such as contour volume, shape descriptors, positional relationships, and basic image characteristics to identify potentially problematic segmentations <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26083863/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">(Altman et al., 2015)</a>. While this approach can effectively identify gross outliers, it struggles with subtle but clinically significant errors and lacks the ability to assess dosimetric impact.</p> <p><strong>Multi-Metric Geometric Assessment</strong>: More sophisticated approaches combine multiple geometric metrics to improve detection accuracy. Duan et al. demonstrated that using 27 different geometric agreement metrics with machine learning classification models could outperform traditional single-metric approaches, achieving recall values of 0.727-0.842 and precision values of 0.762-0.899 for various head and neck structures <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36788735/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">(Duan et al., 2023)</a>. However, even these comprehensive geometric approaches cannot directly address the clinical significance of detected variations.</p> <p><strong>Atlas-Based Validation</strong>: Some systems use anatomical atlases to validate segmentation quality by comparing generated contours against expected anatomical relationships and spatial constraints. Research has shown that performance generally improves with atlas size but reaches a plateau beyond a certain point, suggesting diminishing returns for larger datasets <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31024843/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">(Lee et al., 2019)</a>.</p> <p><strong>Limitations of Traditional Approaches</strong>: Despite their widespread adoption, traditional automated quality assurance approaches share several fundamental limitations:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Geometric Focus</strong>: These methods evaluate contours based on spatial properties without considering their intended clinical use or dosimetric implications.</li> <li> <strong>Context Insensitivity</strong>: Traditional approaches cannot distinguish between errors that have significant clinical impact and those that are dosimetrically insignificant.</li> <li> <strong>Binary Classification</strong>: Most systems provide binary accept/reject decisions rather than prioritized recommendations based on clinical significance.</li> <li> <strong>Limited Adaptability</strong>: Traditional methods typically use fixed thresholds and criteria that cannot adapt to different clinical scenarios or treatment techniques.</li> </ul> <h3 id="modern-deep-learning-based-systems">Modern Deep Learning-Based Systems</h3> <p>The advent of deep learning has enabled more sophisticated approaches to automated contour quality assurance that can potentially address some limitations of traditional methods while introducing new capabilities and challenges.</p> <p><strong>Convolutional Neural Network Approaches</strong>: Recent research has demonstrated impressive results with CNN-based quality assurance tools. Rhee et al. developed a CNN-based system that could detect errors in multi-atlas autocontours with accuracy rates of 80-99% for most head and neck organs at risk <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31505046/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">(Rhee et al., 2019)</a>. In subsequent work focusing on pelvic structures, they found that surface Dice Similarity Coefficient with 1-3 mm tolerances achieved accuracy rates above 90% for targets and critical structures in cervical cancer patients <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9359039/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">(Rhee et al., 2022)</a>.</p> <p><strong>Multi-Modal Integration</strong>: Advanced deep learning systems can integrate information from multiple sources, including medical images, contour geometries, and clinical parameters. This multi-modal approach enables more comprehensive assessment that considers both geometric accuracy and clinical context, though computational requirements and model complexity increase significantly.</p> <p><strong>Uncertainty Quantification</strong>: Modern deep learning approaches increasingly incorporate uncertainty quantification to provide confidence measures alongside quality assessments. This capability is particularly important for clinical decision-making, as it enables more nuanced interpretation of model outputs and appropriate allocation of human review resources.</p> <p><strong>Generative Approaches</strong>: Some research groups have explored generative adversarial networks and variational autoencoders for quality assessment, using these models to generate expected contour distributions and identify outliers based on likelihood assessments. While promising, these approaches require careful validation to ensure that generated distributions accurately reflect clinical acceptability criteria.</p> <h3 id="integration-challenges-and-solutions">Integration Challenges and Solutions</h3> <p>The successful integration of automated quality assurance systems into clinical workflows requires addressing numerous technical, practical, and organizational challenges that extend beyond pure algorithmic performance.</p> <p><strong>Technical Integration</strong>: Modern treatment planning systems use diverse data formats, coordinate systems, and computational architectures that complicate the integration of external quality assurance tools. Successful implementations require robust software interfaces, standardized data exchange protocols, and careful attention to computational performance requirements.</p> <p><strong>Workflow Optimization</strong>: Clinical workflows for contour review and approval vary significantly between institutions and depend on factors such as staffing levels, treatment complexity, and quality assurance protocols. Automated systems must be flexible enough to accommodate these variations while providing sufficient guidance to streamline decision-making processes.</p> <p><strong>User Interface Design</strong>: The design of user interfaces for automated quality assurance systems critically influences their clinical adoption and effectiveness. Interfaces must present complex information in intuitive formats, support rapid decision-making, and integrate seamlessly with existing treatment planning tools. Research in human factors engineering suggests that poorly designed interfaces can actually decrease overall quality assurance effectiveness despite improved algorithmic performance.</p> <p><strong>Performance Monitoring</strong>: Clinical implementation of automated quality assurance requires ongoing performance monitoring to detect model drift, identify edge cases, and ensure continued accuracy across diverse patient populations. This monitoring must account for changes in imaging protocols, treatment techniques, and clinical practices that may affect model performance over time.</p> <p><strong>Training and Change Management</strong>: Successful clinical implementation requires comprehensive training programs that help clinical staff understand system capabilities and limitations while developing appropriate trust calibration. Over-reliance on automated systems can be as problematic as under-utilization, making user education a critical component of successful implementation.</p> <p>Clinical studies of implemented systems have shown promising results. Jin et al. reported that 98% of AI-predicted organs at risk required no revision or only minor revisions before being deemed clinically acceptable, reducing manual contouring time by 90% <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39036546/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">(Jin et al., 2022)</a>. However, these results depend heavily on proper implementation and integration with clinical workflows.</p> <p>The evolution of automated contour quality assurance continues to accelerate, driven by improving algorithmic capabilities and growing clinical demands for efficiency. However, the success of these systems ultimately depends not only on their technical performance but also on their ability to integrate effectively with complex clinical workflows while maintaining appropriate human oversight and decision-making authority.</p> <hr> <h2 id="dose-prediction-models-for-quality-assessment">Dose Prediction Models for Quality Assessment</h2> <p>The application of artificial intelligence-driven dose prediction to contour quality assessment represents a transformative approach that directly addresses the fundamental limitation of traditional geometric evaluation methods: their disconnection from clinical outcomes. By incorporating the downstream dosimetric consequences of segmentation variations into upstream quality assessment, dose prediction models enable clinically meaningful evaluation that prioritizes resources based on potential impact rather than geometric deviation alone.</p> <h3 id="architectural-considerations">Architectural Considerations</h3> <p>The development of effective dose prediction models for contour quality assessment requires careful consideration of architectural choices that balance computational efficiency, prediction accuracy, and clinical interpretability.</p> <p><strong>Convolutional Neural Network Architectures</strong>: Three-dimensional convolutional neural networks have emerged as the predominant architecture for dose prediction due to their ability to process volumetric medical data while preserving spatial relationships. The choice of network depth, filter sizes, and skip connections significantly influences both prediction accuracy and computational requirements. Deeper networks may capture more complex dose-anatomy relationships but require more training data and computational resources.</p> <p><strong>U-Net and Cascaded Architectures</strong>: The U-Net architecture and its variants have shown particular promise for dose prediction applications due to their ability to combine global context with fine-scale spatial details. Cascaded architectures that process data at multiple resolutions can potentially improve efficiency by performing initial predictions at coarse resolution and refining details at higher resolutions. Our research with cascaded 3D U-Net architectures for brain tumor dose prediction demonstrated good sensitivity to radiation dose changes resulting from contour variations (missing reference).</p> <p><strong>Attention Mechanisms</strong>: Attention mechanisms enable models to focus on spatially and dosimetrically relevant regions, potentially improving both prediction accuracy and interpretability. Self-attention layers can help models identify critical anatomical relationships that influence dose distributions, while cross-attention between contours and imaging data can enhance the integration of segmentation information with dose prediction.</p> <p><strong>Physics-Informed Architectures</strong>: Recent research has explored the integration of radiation physics principles directly into neural network architectures. These approaches constrain model predictions to be consistent with fundamental physical laws, potentially improving generalization and reducing the data requirements for training. However, the computational complexity of such approaches may limit their applicability in real-time clinical workflows.</p> <h3 id="training-methodologies-and-data-requirements">Training Methodologies and Data Requirements</h3> <p>The successful training of dose prediction models requires addressing unique challenges related to data collection, preprocessing, and optimization that differ significantly from traditional computer vision applications.</p> <p><strong>Data Collection and Standardization</strong>: Training effective dose prediction models requires large datasets of paired imaging, segmentation, and dose distribution data. However, dose distributions are highly dependent on treatment planning parameters, optimization objectives, and institutional protocols, creating challenges for model generalization. Standardization of dose prescriptions, planning techniques, and optimization criteria is essential for creating robust training datasets.</p> <p><strong>Multi-Institutional Considerations</strong>: Single-institution datasets may not capture the full diversity of clinical practices, patient populations, and technical implementations encountered in real-world applications. Multi-institutional data collection efforts face challenges related to data privacy, technical standardization, and institutional review board approval, but are essential for developing generalizable models.</p> <p><strong>Augmentation Strategies</strong>: Data augmentation techniques for dose prediction must preserve the physical relationships between anatomy and dose distributions. Traditional image augmentation methods such as rotation and scaling may not be appropriate for dose data, requiring the development of specialized augmentation techniques that maintain dosimetric consistency.</p> <p><strong>Loss Function Design</strong>: The choice of loss functions significantly influences model behavior and clinical utility. Mean squared error loss may not adequately capture the clinical significance of dose prediction errors, leading researchers to explore more sophisticated loss functions that weight errors based on dose levels, anatomical importance, or clinical constraints. Dose-volume histogram (DVH) based loss functions and clinical metric-based objectives show promise for training clinically relevant models.</p> <p><strong>Transfer Learning and Domain Adaptation</strong>: The limited availability of training data for specific anatomical sites and treatment techniques has motivated research into transfer learning approaches that can adapt models trained on one clinical scenario to another. Domain adaptation techniques may enable the efficient development of site-specific models while leveraging broader training datasets.</p> <h3 id="validation-and-performance-metrics">Validation and Performance Metrics</h3> <p>The validation of dose prediction models for quality assessment requires metrics that capture both prediction accuracy and clinical utility while accounting for the unique characteristics of dose distributions and their clinical interpretation.</p> <p><strong>Traditional Dose Metrics</strong>: Standard dosimetric evaluation metrics such as dose difference maps, gamma analysis, and dose-volume histogram comparisons provide quantitative assessments of prediction accuracy. However, these metrics may not adequately capture the clinical significance of prediction errors or their implications for quality assessment applications.</p> <p><strong>Clinical Endpoint Correlation</strong>: The ultimate validation of dose prediction models lies in their correlation with clinical endpoints such as tumor control probability and normal tissue complication probability. However, establishing these correlations requires long-term follow-up data and large patient cohorts, making such validation studies challenging and time-consuming.</p> <p><strong>Sensitivity Analysis</strong>: Our research has demonstrated the importance of systematic sensitivity analysis to evaluate how dose prediction models respond to controlled variations in input segmentations (missing reference). These analyses help establish the clinical utility of models for quality assessment by quantifying their ability to detect dosimetrically significant segmentation errors.</p> <p><strong>Uncertainty Quantification</strong>: Clinical decision-making requires not only point estimates of dose distributions but also confidence intervals and uncertainty quantification. Bayesian deep learning approaches and ensemble methods can provide uncertainty estimates, but their computational requirements and interpretability remain active areas of research.</p> <p><strong>Real-World Performance</strong>: Laboratory validation may not accurately reflect real-world performance due to differences in data quality, clinical workflows, and user behavior. Prospective clinical validation studies are essential for establishing the practical utility of dose prediction models, though such studies require careful design to ensure patient safety and regulatory compliance.</p> <p>The development of dose prediction models for quality assessment continues to evolve rapidly, driven by advancing computational capabilities and growing clinical demands for more efficient and accurate quality assurance methods. Success in this field requires balancing multiple competing objectives: prediction accuracy, computational efficiency, clinical interpretability, and practical implementation requirements. The ongoing research addresses these challenges through innovative architectural designs, sophisticated training methodologies, and comprehensive validation frameworks that collectively advance the field toward clinically viable solutions.</p> <hr> <h2 id="our-research-contributions">Our Research Contributions</h2> <p>Our research program has made significant contributions to the field of dose prediction-based contour quality assessment through systematic investigation of deep learning model sensitivity, development of novel visualization and analysis tools, and comprehensive clinical validation studies. These contributions advance both the theoretical understanding and practical implementation of dose-aware quality assurance in radiation therapy.</p> <h3 id="sensitivity-analysis-of-deep-learning-dose-prediction">Sensitivity Analysis of Deep Learning Dose Prediction</h3> <p>A critical aspect of using dose prediction models for contour quality assessment is understanding their sensitivity to segmentation variations—that is, their ability to detect and accurately quantify the dosimetric impact of contour changes. Our research has systematically investigated this fundamental question through comprehensive sensitivity analysis studies.</p> <p><strong>Cascaded 3D U-Net Architecture</strong>: We developed and evaluated a cascaded 3D U-Net architecture specifically optimized for dose prediction in brain tumor radiotherapy (missing reference). This architecture processes volumetric data at multiple resolutions, enabling efficient computation while maintaining spatial detail necessary for accurate dose prediction. The cascaded approach first generates coarse dose predictions and then refines them through higher-resolution processing, achieving a favorable balance between computational efficiency and prediction accuracy.</p> <p><strong>Controlled Sensitivity Experiments</strong>: To systematically evaluate model sensitivity, we designed controlled experiments where we introduced known variations to reference contours and analyzed the corresponding changes in predicted dose distributions.

Users can select regions of interest, apply various modification patterns, and immediately visualize the resulting dose changes. This capability supports both quality assessment and education applications.</p> <p><strong>Validation Studies</strong>: We validated the ASTRA framework through systematic comparison with expert assessments and clinical planning studies. The framework successfully identified regions where expert planners made manual contour adjustments during clinical review, demonstrating its ability to predict areas of dosimetric sensitivity.</p> <p><strong>Clinical Applications</strong>: The ASTRA framework has multiple clinical applications:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Prioritized Quality Assurance</strong>: The framework can guide manual review efforts by highlighting regions where careful examination is most important.</li> <li> <strong>Training and Education</strong>: The visual feedback provided by ASTRA can help train less experienced practitioners by demonstrating the dosimetric consequences of contouring decisions.</li> <li> <strong>Algorithm Development</strong>: The detailed sensitivity maps can inform the development of more targeted automatic segmentation algorithms that prioritize accuracy in dosimetrically critical regions.</li> </ul> <h3 id="clinical-validation-and-performance-assessment">Clinical Validation and Performance Assessment</h3> <p>Our research program includes comprehensive clinical validation studies that evaluate the practical utility and clinical impact of dose prediction-based quality assessment approaches.</p> <p><strong>Multi-Site Validation</strong>: We conducted validation studies across multiple institutions to assess the generalizability of our approaches.
