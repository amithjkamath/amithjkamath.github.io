API: "A set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications."
CI/CD: "Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment, a method for automating testing and deployment."
DevOps: "A set of practices that combines software development and IT operations."
IMRT: "Intensity-modulated radiation therapy, or IMRT, is a type of cancer treatment that uses advanced computer programs to calculate and deliver radiation directly to cancer cells from different angles. It allows people with cancer to receive higher, more effective doses of radiation while limiting damage to the healthy tissues and organs around it. This increases your chance for a cure and lessens the likelihood of side effects."
VMAT: "Volumetric modulated arc therapy, or VMAT, is a type of external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) healthcare providers use to treat cancer. With EBRT, a machine that never touches your body sends radiation to destroy tumors. VMAT is a newer form of EBRT that was introduced in 2007. With VMAT, the machine rotates around your body while youu are lying down, delivering continuous doses of radiation toward a tumor. No radiation source is placed inside your body, so there is no concern of being radioactive during or after the radiation treatments. VMAT is also a form of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). IMRT sends various doses of radiation toward a tumor across multiple smaller beams instead of using a single radiation beam. This technique allows healthcare providers to direct high doses of radiation toward tumors without exposing the surrounding healthy tissue to harmful amounts of radiation. During VMAT, you receive customized doses of radiation as a machine encircles your body in one or more rotations, or arcs."
