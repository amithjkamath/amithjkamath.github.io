The machine rotates around your body while youu are lying down, delivering continuous doses of radiation toward a tumor. No radiation source is placed inside your body, so there is no concern of being radioactive during or after the radiation treatments. With VMAT, you receive customized doses of radiation as a machine encircles your body in one or more rotations, or arcs."
