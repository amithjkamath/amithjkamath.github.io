## Academic Service and Professional Contributions

### Conference Organization

**March 2025** | I am currently serving as **Lead Organizer** for the [Bern AI in Radiotherapy (BART) Symposium](https://amithjkamath.github.io/bart25), an international event that has attracted over 100 attendees from 5 countries. The symposium brings together experts across radiation oncology, medical physics, and AI engineering through three keynote presentations, alongside 11 poster presentations and 3 flash talks. This full-day technical event focuses on fostering cross-disciplinary collaboration at the intersection of artificial intelligence and clinical radiotherapy practice.

**March 2023** | I co-organized the [Bern Interpretable AI (BIAS) Symposium](https://amithjkamath.github.io/bias23), a hybrid event that successfully attracted 140 researchers, with 70 participating online from 5 different countries. The symposium took place in the University of Bern's prestigious Cupola room, where we coordinated international poster presentations and technical sessions. This event established a new networking platform for the interpretable AI research community, bringing together researchers focused on making AI systems more transparent and understandable.

### Educational Instruction and Workshops

**October 2019** | At [IEEE TenCon 2019](https://www.tencon2019.org/tutorial.html), I delivered a comprehensive 3-hour interactive tutorial titled "Deep Learning with MATLAB" to more than 50 attendees. This session became the highest attended parallel tutorial at the conference, featuring extensive audience engagement throughout. The curriculum covered essential topics including network design principles, visualization techniques, training challenges, and GPU deployment strategies for deep learning applications.

**August 2019** | I conducted a full-day workshop called "Demystifying Deep Learning using MATLAB" at [IEEE DISCOVER 2019](https://2019.ieee-discover.org/?q=article/pre-conference-tutorialsworkshops), working with 30 participants through hands-on learning experiences. The comprehensive curriculum included practical training on pre-trained networks, transfer learning methodologies, training neural networks from scratch, and GPU deployment techniques. The workshop emphasized hands-on computer vision demonstrations that connected theoretical concepts to practical applications.

## University Teaching and Curriculum Development

### Medical Image Analysis Laboratory, University of Bern

**2024** | I served as **Course Instructor** for the [Medical Image Analysis course](https://github.com/ubern-mialab/MIALab), working alongside Shelley to introduce innovative teaching methodologies including GitHub Classroom for streamlined assignment management. The course maintained an excellent evaluation score of 4.89, with students providing enthusiastic feedback such as *"Absolutely enjoyed this course... fantastic job... highly appreciate how interactive the course was."* This year marked continued refinement of the hands-on, interactive approach that has proven successful in previous iterations.

**2023** | Continuing as **Course Instructor** for the [Medical Image Analysis course](https://github.com/ubern-mia/MIALab), I collaborated with Shelley and Mike to implement several educational innovations including video lectures, project-specific Slack channels for enhanced communication, and organized hospital clinic visits to connect classroom learning with real-world medical imaging practice. These enhancements contributed to achieving an outstanding course evaluation score of 4.92, with student feedback highlighting *"Improved programming skills... TA was extremely helpful and nice!"*

**2022** | I took on the role of **Course Instructor** for the [Medical Image Analysis course](https://github.com/ubern-mia/MIALab), working with Elias and Jayden to undertake a significant curriculum transformation. Through comprehensive redesign of course content and teaching methodologies, we achieved a remarkable 53% improvement in student satisfaction, increasing the course evaluation score from 3.25 in 2021 to 4.94 in 2022. This dramatic improvement demonstrated the effectiveness of our new interactive, hands-on approach to teaching complex medical imaging concepts.

### Biomedical Engineering Laboratory

**2022** | I served as **Lab Instructor** for the [Biomedical Engineering rotation course](https://github.com/ubern-mia/bme-labs), collaborating with Yannick to design a practical introductory experience for incoming Masters' students. This rotation course provided students with hands-on exposure to Medical Image Analysis research methodology, helping them understand fundamental concepts and research approaches in the field before beginning their specialized studies.

## Independent Educational Initiatives

Beyond formal university teaching roles, I have developed several independent educational projects that serve the broader research and engineering community. My [AI in Radiotherapy](https://github.com/amithjkamath/tara) project provides open-source educational content that makes advanced concepts accessible to researchers worldwide. Additionally, I created the [BENDER Learning Modules](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLo8azKzU7Iq8IHJ5PW8DAk-yaO8i4lBP_), a series of technical workshops that have been delivered across India, providing practical training in advanced computational methods.

These initiatives reflect my commitment to curriculum development spanning computer science, biomedical engineering, and mathematics, with a focus on making complex technical concepts accessible through interactive, hands-on learning approaches that connect theoretical understanding with practical application.
