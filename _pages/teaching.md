## 2025
### March 2025 - Bern AI in Radiotherapy (BART) Symposium

Robert and I are co-organizers of BART, a one-day symposium for AI in Radiotherapy. We have three keynote speakers across radiation oncology, medical physics and engineering/AI. More to be updated here soon. Details at [the official website](https://ubern-mia.github.io/bart25).

## 2024
### (Fall - Uni Bern) Medical Image Analysis Lab

In Fall 2024, Shelley and I ran the [2024 version of MIA Lab](https://github.com/ubern-mialab/MIALab). 

This iteration featured new content - using GitHub classroom for assignments, updated simpler starter code repository and organization. Course evaluation score remains high at 4.89, and here's a student comment: "I absolutely enjoyed this course. I think that Shelley and Amith did a fantastic job with this course. I highly appreciate how interactive the course was during the lecture portion and how available and helpful they were during the lab portion. During the projects, we had quite some freedom to experiment which I think is great for our learning process and the feedback/guidance from the TAs has been really great."

## 2023
### (Fall - Uni Bern) Medical Image Analysis Lab

In Fall 2023, Shelley, Mike and I ran the [2023 version of MIA Lab](https://github.com/ubern-mia/MIALab). 

Changes in this iteration include project specific slack channels, video lectures along with in-class presentation, and hospital clinic visit. Course evaluation score remains high at 4.92. Here's a comment from the evaluation: "I got to improve my programming skills and the TA was extremely helpful and nice!"

### March 2023 - Bern Interpretable AI Symposium (BIAS)

Yannick and I are co-organizers of BIAS, a one-day symposium for Interpretable AI, hosted at the Cupola room at the Uni Bern main building. We have an attendance of 140 researchers (70 online) and posters from 5 countries. Read more on [the official website](https://www.caim.unibe.ch/about_us/news_and_events/events_2022/bias_symposium/index_eng.html).

### (Spring - Uni Bern) Biomedical Engineering Lab

Yannick and I are running a short practical rotation course called [BME Labs](https://github.com/ubern-mia/bme-labs) for incoming Masters' students in Biomedical Engineering to get a quick overview of what we do in the Medical Image Analysis lab.

These are three week long guided experiments to analyze behavior of deep learning classification models - heavily borrowed from the BENDER episodes.

## 2022
### (Fall - Uni Bern) Medical Image Analysis Lab

In Fall 2022, Elias, Jayden and I are running the [2022 version of MIA Lab](https://github.com/ubern-mia/MIALab). 

We complement the theory taught in the Medical Image Analysis course for Masters and PhD students here at Uni Bern. The overall course evaluation score increased from 3.25 in 2021 before I was involved to 4.94 this year!

### (Summer - MICCAI Education Challenge) BENDER Series of videos for Deep Learning

See [here for BENDER](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkMl6tVyRVnBmOYv8t2q0yw): a four part series of fun educational videos to learn nuances of Deep Learning as applied to Medical Imaging. 

We have also created a [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ubern-mia/bender) which includes supporting material, including code and references. I play the role of a new graduate student who learns the ropes over four episodes.
