I am [Amith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit) Kamath, and I have some experience in computer vision, production-grade software design, and medical applications at the University of Bern. I earned a PhD with Prof. [Mauricio Reyes](https://mauricioreyes.me) at the [MIA Lab @ ARTORG](https://www.artorg.unibe.ch) in September 2025. My work explored the intersection of artificial intelligence and medicine, with a focus on developing robust deep learning models [[NeurIPS-w '22](/projects/2022-medneurips-contextvsfbr-tradeoff), [MICCAI '23, CiBM '25](/projects/2023-miccai-skip-connections)] for applications such as radiotherapy planning [[MIDL '24, RadOnc '25](/projects/2024-midl-radonc-vs-dldp)] and automated segmentation quality assurance [[EMBC '23 (2nd best paper award)](/projects/2023-embc-astra)]. 

I enjoy [teaching/mentoring](/service/), organizing workshop and symposia [[BIAS '23](https://amithjkamath.github.io/bias23), [BART '25](https://amithjkamath.github.io/bart25)], fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing within our scientific communities.

See [here](/publications/) for a more complete list of publications.

**Technical Expertise:** Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Medical Imaging, Python, MATLAB, Clinical AI Deployment.

**In a past life:** I contributed to computer vision and image processing API and Apps at MathWorks [[MONAI+MATLAB '25](/projects/teach-2024-monai-with-matlab), [Driving Demo '18](https://ch.mathworks.com/help/driving/ug/evaluate-and-visualize-lane-boundary-detections-against-ground-truth.html), [NIfTI File I/O '17](https://ch.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/niftiread.html)]; earned a Master's degree in Computer Science from [Georgia Tech](https://omscs.gatech.edu); and studied dMRI optimization at the [University of Minnesota](https://conservancy.umn.edu/items/8f9e7c4d-8d1f-47e8-897d-b7c5e00bff6e), [[MICCAI-w '12](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=dea85ae121334b35da1cdb81537f6b0683e7250b)].
