I am [Amith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit) Kamath, a recent PhD graduate in Medical Image Analysis from the University of Bern, where I conducted research under Prof. Mauricio Reyes at the [ARTORG Center](https://www.artorg.unibe.ch). My work explores the intersection of artificial intelligence and medicine, with a focus on developing robust deep learning models for applications such as radiotherapy planning and automated segmentation quality assurance. My work spans the following themes: [robustness of image segmentation models](/projects/thesis-robustness-of-image-segmentation-models), [fast radiotherapy dose prediction](/projects/thesis-dose-prediction-for-contour-evaluation), and [segmentation quality assurance](/projects/thesis-contour-correction-qualitative-analysis).

I am currently working on the translational potential of my research through a Venture Fellowship at the University of Bern, investigating opportunities to bridge innovative AI solutions with real-world clinical challenges.

**Technical Expertise:** Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Medical Imaging, Python, MATLAB, Clinical AI Deployment.

**Background:** I have experience in multidisciplinary clinical research as well as shipping production-grade software. I contributed to computer vision and image processing API and Apps at [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com/products/computer-vision.html); earned a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science from [Georgia Tech](https://omscs.gatech.edu); and studied dMRI optimization at the [University of Minnesota](https://conservancy.umn.edu/items/8f9e7c4d-8d1f-47e8-897d-b7c5e00bff6e). I enjoy mentoring, organizing workshop and symposia, fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing within our scientific communities.
