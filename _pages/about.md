My name is [Amith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit) (meaning 'infinite' in Sanskrit) and I am a doctoral student under Prof. Mauricio Reyes at the [ARTORG Center](https://www.artorg.unibe.ch) Medical Image Analysis lab, specializing in pixel-level segmentation using deep learning for radiotherapy planning. My research focuses on enhancing model robustness in clinical settings. I hold a masterâ€™s degree in vision and robotics from at [Georgia Tech](https://omscs.gatech.edu) and completed a dissertation at [Minnesota](https://github.com/amithjkamath/CSAODFcode), optimizing MRI acquisition for accurate white matter fiber orientation measurement.

Previously, I developed image and vision processing tools at [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com/products/computer-vision.html), created technical content for undergraduate courses, and conducted [workshops/seminars across India](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLo8azKzU7Iq8IHJ5PW8DAk-yaO8i4lBP_) in computer science, biomedical engineering, and mathematics.

[Here](../assets/pdf/amithjkamath_cv.pdf) is my CV. I am grateful to call Bern, Bengaluru, Boston, Minneapolis, and Mangalore as home.
