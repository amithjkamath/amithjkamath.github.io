I am [Amith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit) Kamath, a computer vision and machine learning expert with a PhD in Medical Image Analysis from the University of Bern, specializing in deep learning for radiotherapy planning under Prof. Mauricio Reyes at the [ARTORG Center](https://www.artorg.unibe.ch). My work focuses on AI model development for medical imaging and clinical deployment, on these three themes: [automated segmentation quality assurance](/projects/thesis-contour-correction-qualitative-analysis), [deep learning radiotherapy dose predictions](/projects/thesis-dose-prediction-for-contour-evaluation) and [robustness of image segmentation models](/projects/thesis-robustness-of-image-segmentation-models).

I have experience in academic research and software development, building computer vision tools at [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com/products/computer-vision.html), a Master's in Computer Science from [Georgia Tech](https://omscs.gatech.edu), and MRI optimization research at the [University of Minnesota](https://www.ece.umn.edu).

In 2025-26, I am exploring building a spinoff to apply my expertise in computer vision and AI to real-world challenges. I have led workshops, mentored students, and organized symposia.

**Technical Expertise:** Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Medical Imaging, Python, MATLAB, Clinical AI Deployment.
