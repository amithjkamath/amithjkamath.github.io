My name is [Amith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit), and I am experienced in computer vision, production-grade software design, and clinical imaging applications. I earned a PhD with Prof. [Mauricio Reyes](https://mauricioreyes.me) at the [MIA Lab](https://www.artorg.unibe.ch) in September 2025. My work explores the intersection of artificial intelligence and medicine, with a focus on developing robust image segmentation models [[NeurIPS-w '22](/projects/22-MedNeurIPS), [MICCAI '23, CiBM '25](/projects/23-MICCAI)] toward evaluating contour correction efficiency for radiotherapy [[MIDL '24, RadOnc '25](/projects/24-MIDL)] and fast treatment planning dose proposals [[ISBI '23, Cancers '23](/projects/23-ISBI)]. I also delve into clinically translatable work derived from the above topics [[EMBC '23 (2nd best paper award)](/projects/23-EMBC)]. 

I enjoy [teaching/mentoring](/service/), organizing workshops and symposia [[BIAS '23](https://amithjkamath.github.io/bias23), [BART '25](https://amithjkamath.github.io/bart25)], and collaborating within our interdisciplinary communities.

See [here](/publications/) for a more complete list of publications.

**In a past life:** I contributed to computer vision and image processing API and Apps at MathWorks [[MONAI+MATLAB '25](/projects/teach-2024-monai-with-matlab), [MATLABmedMNIST '24](https://github.com/amithjkamath/matlabmedmnist), [Driving Demo '18](https://ch.mathworks.com/help/driving/ug/evaluate-and-visualize-lane-boundary-detections-against-ground-truth.html), [NIfTI File I/O '17](https://ch.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/niftiread.html)]; earned a Master's degree in Computer Science from [Georgia Tech](https://omscs.gatech.edu); and studied dMRI optimization at [Minnesota](https://conservancy.umn.edu/items/8f9e7c4d-8d1f-47e8-897d-b7c5e00bff6e) [[ISMRM '13](https://archive.ismrm.org/2013/0059.html), [MICCAI-w '12](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=dea85ae121334b35da1cdb81537f6b0683e7250b)].
