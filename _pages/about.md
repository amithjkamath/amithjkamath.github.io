I am [Amith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit) Kamath, a computer vision and machine learning expert with a PhD in Medical Image Analysis from the University of Bern, where I specialized in deep learning applications for radiotherapy planning under Prof. Mauricio Reyes at the [ARTORG Center](https://www.artorg.unibe.ch). My research focused on developing robust AI models for pixel-level segmentation in clinical environments, with expertise spanning medical imaging, model robustness, and deployment in healthcare settings.

I am fortunate to have experience with both academic research and production-level software development, having previously developed computer vision and image processing tools at [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com/products/computer-vision.html). My technical background includes a Master's degree in Computer Science with a focus on vision and robotics from [Georgia Tech](https://omscs.gatech.edu), and specialized research in MRI optimization at the University of Minnesota.

For 2025-26, I am exploring how to translate my doctoral research into a spinoff, where I can apply my expertise in computer vision, deep learning, and AI model development to solve real-world challenges. My experience includes leading technical workshops, mentoring students, organizing international symposia, and translating complex research into practical applications.

**Technical expertise:** Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Medical Imaging, Model Robustness, Python, MATLAB, Clinical AI Deployment
